<h1>Porcelain Philosophy</h1>
<hr>
<p>This is <strong>some text</strong> about a porcelain throne epiphany:</p>
As my gaze traversed the bathroom landscape a shame filled realization dawned:<br>
<ol>
	<li>I sat and shat <em>before</em> the presence of shitpaper was verified.</li>
</ol>
Denial began its work, forcing an intensive scan of the area.
	<ul>
		<li>There, on the floor beside the toilet, a mostly gone roll whose last remains lay unwound in a messy heap.</li>
		<li>Three year olds are excellent mischief makers, like drunken leprochauns who tirelessly roam the house laying waste to ordered entities; this roll of paper poop squares had no chance against such a foe.</li>
	</ul>
	As I looked down on the crumpled tissues and contemplated my situation with disgust a bolt of lightning struck my mind: just how clean does that have to be before it is put to work scrubbing my anus?<br>
	Perhaps I have been prudish with my pucky paper. <strong><em>No longer.</em></strong> What a freeing realization.
